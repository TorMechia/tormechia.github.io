I'll tell you who you really are. [r]
Hahaha. I wonder why I didn't notice it for months. [l][r]
It was such a simple thing. I'm sure even Yuri will understand! [l][r]
[r] “Ahahahahahahahaha” I laugh. [l][r]

"...What's really going on? Are you okay?" [r]
Yuu is worried about me. [l][r]
Yu is next to me. [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[r]That was a shame. You came out at the wrong time. There's not even one chance in a billion for you to win! [l][r]
"Ah... ah. Ahahahaha. [r]
……it's okay. You” [l][r]
Don't worry. I will protect you. [l][r]
[r]I won't let anyone hurt Yuri anymore. Even if it was me. [l][r]

[r]Your true identity is... ``Despair.'' [l][r]
I said that to my very heart. [l][r]

If you think about it, we were always together. [l][r]
Both before and after accepting it. [r]
Even after I disappeared from this world, you followed me around. [l][r]

...If I wasn't here, Chito and Yuri would suffer even more, right? It's always been painful not being able to see you and feeling lonely, you know? [l][r]
Will that continue? "You don't know when it's going to end, do you?" [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[tb_start_text mode=3 ]
[r]It's okay. Thanks. You really like us... [l][r]
But that's okay. [r]
The end will definitely come. [l][r]
There's no end to good things and no end to bad things. [l][r]

[r]You were the one who taught me that. [l][r]
Are you okay. ...We will live laughing, and we will surely die laughing. [l][r]
