"What do you mean you don't understand?" [l][r]
Kanazawa says. Ishii supports my shoulders. [r]
"That's why I don't know. There is another replica of the same model on display over there, but this one is not registered for display."[l][r]
A person who seemed to be a staff member said that. From the corner of my eye, I vaguely saw Kanazawa's wife picking up my baggage that I had dropped. [l][r]
I couldn't take my eyes off the vehicle in front of me. [r]
Kettenkrad is a semi-tracked vehicle with tires on the front wheels and tracks on the rear. It's a replica. [l][r]
It's just a copy made by someone who loves things. [l][r]

“So, no one here knows who left this and who owns it?” [r]
I heard Ishii's voice, but I couldn't trace its meaning. [l][r]
My hand reached out. I touched the key, then the ignition button. I checked the feel. [l][r]

Eventually my eyes adjusted and I was able to see. [l][r]
[r]Kettenkrad. [r]
[r]A key with a fish on it. [l][r]
[r]But it was "real". [l][r]
