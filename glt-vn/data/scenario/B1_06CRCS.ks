"What?" [l][r]
Chi-chan was sitting on my lap, staring blankly at the moon and opening her mouth. [l][r]
[r] "This is the world. It's convenient, isn't it?" [l][r]
"Yeah. We don't have to worry about food, clothes, baths, or anything else." [r]
"Ah. That's right. But" [l][r]
[r]Chi-chan said as she drank more alcohol. Her face was already red. [l][r]

"It's fun to study and work part-time, but when there are so many people around, it's hard to understand a lot of things."[l][r]
"...That's right." [l][r]
"Every day, every day. I'm living desperately, trying to survive, but I'm not getting anything in return." [l][r]

The sound of a can being crushed. [l][r]

[r] "In fact, I'm just losing everything. I'm losing everything." [l][r]
"...Yeah" [l][r]
“I feel like I want to forget everything.” [l][r]
"...Yeah" [l][r]
“……Hehe, that’s strange, me” [l][r]

With a wry smile, Chi-chan gulps down the last sip. It was dark and I couldn't see clearly, but there were several beer cans lying around Chi-chan. Maybe he drank alcohol to force himself to sleep. [l][r]
[r] Chi-chan crushes the empty can and throws it across the room. [l][r]

"Ah. This world is so troublesome." [l][r]
Her empty eyes stared blankly at the round moon. I thought Chi-chan's soul was going to be sucked into the moon, so I hugged her from behind [r]
Ru. [l][r]
[r] "...That's right. I guess it feels cramped." [l][r]
[r] Chi-chan says, “It’s right.” I glanced at Chi-chan's face, which was right next to me, and saw dark circles under her eyes. I guess she doesn't sleep much. [l][r]

"Yeah. Come to think of it, I've never been out at night before." [l][r]

Chi-chan smiles. The smile on his face looked like he was in a lot of pain, and I could tell that he wanted to feel better even just a little bit [r]
Ru. [l]If it was Chi-chan before, I'm sure she wouldn't have said or thought something like this. [l][r]
But I don't say I don't like it. If I say that, Chi-chan will break down. He has always wondered what to do to keep it from breaking. [l][r]
[r]There's only one thing I can do. [l][r]
"Good. Let's go." [l][r]
[r]My goal is to make as many of Chi-chan's wishes come true as possible. [l][r]

Late night. After leaving the house, we took the last train to the downtown area. Even though it was already time for the date to change, there were still people everywhere. [l] A scene that would be completely unimaginable in the other world. Glaring neon lights, people calling into shops, drunk people making noise and sleeping on the road. [l][r]
Even though it was night, the city was incredibly lively. The first time I came to the downtown area late at night, it was much more lively than during the day, and yet it was a mess. [l][r]

But it was strangely fun, and we were quickly engulfed by the atmosphere. [l][r]
"It's kind of amazing." [l][r]
"Yeah" [r]
“Everyone is playing.” [l][r]
"Like an idiot" [r]
"... Shall we play too?" [l][r]
"...hehe. Yeah" [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

we played around a lot. To get used to the atmosphere, I went to an all-you-can-drink karaoke bar and just drank. [l][r]
"Hehehe, Yuuu!!" [l][r]
“Oh, Chi-chan. [r]
Look, the song begins! ”[l][r]
"Ah, hehe, I'll let you hear my beautiful voice!" [l][r]
“Yay!” [l][r]
"What's that? It won't be graded. It's broken." [l][r]
"Ahaha, Chi-chan's microphone isn't turned on!" [l][r]
“It’s true, ahahahaha!” [l][r]
"Hehehehe, hahahaha!" [l][r]

I want to forget. Anyway, nothing. With that in mind, we enter the izakaya without thinking about what happens next. [l][r]

[r] "Hahahaha, try drinking this alcohol, it'll only burn your throat!" [l][r]
“Which one… ah, ah, kefu, this is amazing Nechi-chan! [r]
Fuel, fuel! ”[l][r]
"Really! Are you going to crash into a vehicle?" [l][r]
[r]We make noise. I order a strong drink that I've never had before, and I just make a fuss and drink it. One cup, two cups, three cups, it was delicious. All the snacks are delicious too. [l][r]

"Uppu, eweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" [l][r]
"Chi-chan, oh Chi-chan, it's too much, uppup" [l][r]
"Oh yeah... hehe, hehehe, Yuu is wearing it too, hehehehe, ugh" [l][r]
"Chi-chan... morning sickness, oh yeah" [l][r]
[r]I vomited many times. [l][r]
[r] “U-pu, let’s go next!” [l][r]
"Yoshikita!" [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[r]Anyway, I tried to forget. [l][r]
This moment is about to break. [l][r]

“Okay, I grabbed it! [r]
Just a little more… oh already! [r]
Hey you, this crane rip-off [r]
is! I can't take it at all! ”[l][r]
[r] Chi-chan gets angry when she gets stuck on the glass of the crane game. When viewed from the side, his cheeks were pressed together and he looked interesting. [l][r]

“It’s just for Chi-chan” [r]
"What! It's definitely the machine's fault!" [l][r]

Chi-chan protests, turning towards me and turning red in the face. Then, he seemed to have found something and turned his gaze behind me. [l][r]
[r] "Oh, what is that... ah, it's a shooting game" [l][r]

My whole body feels cold. [l][r]
[r] “You once told me something like, ``You're no good.'' Alright, then, I'll show you my true ability.'' [l][r]
With that said, Chi-chan puts money in and starts playing the game. [l][r]
[r]A target pops out on the screen, but Chi-chan shoots in the wrong direction. [l][r]
"Hey, you just hit the mark!" [l][r]
"Chi-chan, I'll come next time" [l][r]
“Look at this!!” [l][r]

Chi-chan shoots at the targets that fly by. All of them hit in the wrong direction and give you a score. [l][r]
[r] "Ahaha, look at you! It's perfectly round and has 0 points!" [l][r]
"Ahahaha, that's cool" [l][r]
"Come on, you try it. It's good, isn't it?" [l][r]
[r] Saying that, Chi-chan tries to hand me the gun. [r]
I stare at it for a while. [l][r]

"...I'm sorry, Chi-chan. I'll refrain." [l][r]
[r]I answer with my best smile. [r]
I wonder if it's okay. I wonder if I'm able to deceive it properly. [l][r]
Chi-chan looked a little strange. But he immediately smiled and fell down on me as if a string had been cut. [l][r]

[r]Chi-chan weakly grabbed my arm and fell asleep. Maybe she was tired from all the drinking and noise. I'm glad I can handle alcohol. [l][r]
[cm] Chi-chan is sleeping peacefully and comfortably. I gently pat its head. [l]I was so happy at that moment that I was able to forget everything. [l][r]
[r]Oh no. [l][r]
