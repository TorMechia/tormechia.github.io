[r]"Ishii...where am I?" [l][r]
``It's a hospital,'' Kanazawa, who was standing in the back, told me. [r]
Ishii holds my head in his chest and cries like he's on fire. [l][r]
I patted Ishii on the head and briefly explained what had happened so that we could fit in during visiting hours. [l][r]

Eventually, visiting hours are over and everyone pulls out. [l] Kanazawa's wife told me that my parents from this side of the world will also be arriving here soon. [l][r]

"...I have to go home now. Everyone must be worried." [l][r]
"Yes. I'll be lonely again," Yu said with a smile that belied his words. [l][r]
"I'll see you again." [l][r]
"That's right." [l][r]

“Tell me one thing,” Yu said. [l][r]

"Oh, I'm happy. What about you?" [l][r]
"Me too." [l][r]
