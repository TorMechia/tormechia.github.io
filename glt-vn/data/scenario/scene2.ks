About a year has passed since my first "awakening."
[r]I have no idea that my experience in that world is a dream. [r]
This is because the quantity and quality of memories, as well as the sense of reality, are very different from normal dreams. [l][r]
That, that hierarchical city, is definitely a world that I experienced firsthand. [r]
I was born there, grew up there, lived there, crashed there, wandered there, and died there. [l][r]

But at the same time, there are also memories of life in modern Japan and the past. [l][r]
Born in a rural area, he had an ordinary childhood, then went to a science and engineering school, studied aerodynamics and mechanical engineering, earned a degree, and joined his current company. [r]
I feel that these memories are real, and my parents and grandparents are still alive and well in my hometown.[l][r]

[tb_start_text mode=3 ]
So let me ask you a question. [r]
Which memory is more authentic? [l][r]
[r]The answer is, "They're both real." It may seem contradictory, but... [l][r]
[r] Eventually, as I kept asking myself these questions, I began to think that it didn't matter. [r]
There are always questions that cannot be answered, such as the five-minute world hypothesis. [l][r]
However, even if I tried to explain it that way, I was still left with a feeling of doubt or sentimentality that I couldn't shake. [l][r]

A subcontractor of an aircraft manufacturer. A certain office in a certain department is my workplace in this world. [r]
Currently, the team is working hard day and night to design new parts. [l][r]
[r]But it's a shame. The drawings seen in that world left behind many things that cannot be understood or realized with the technology of today's world. [l][r]
I think it's really a shame. At that time, I focused only on the practical aspects of flight, and did not try to understand the theory or design that was useless. [l][r]

If I could understand just one of these futuristic technologies (what I believe to be) and make them manifest in this world, I would have been able to easily make a fortune. [l][r]

“Mr. Ishii, did you see the email from the general affairs office?” [r]
A colleague calls out to me from the side. [l][r]
“Which email?” [r]
``I've only received one forwarded email. I've been receiving an email from a student with a strange inquiry, and it seems that it's also being sent to colleagues and related companies with the same content.[l] [r]
I had a quick look at the contents, but I think Ishii-san might have something to do with it [r]
……”[l][r]
what's that. Why do I have to be involved in such a spam email thing? [r]
Although I don't say it out loud, I look through the internal mailer, feeling deeply troubled. Is this it? [l][r]

I head towards the edge of the roof, avoiding the corner where the ashtray is placed, where smokers rarely come. [l][r]
