...When Yu said that much, he looked straight at me, a little embarrassed, but also happy. [l][r]
[r]I see... When I asked about it, there was nothing wrong with it; it was just that the wastewater goes to the water purification equipment, and the equipment that uses the water purification needs it. [l][r]

[r] "Did you know? You can eat potato rope!" [l][r]
"Rope? ... Ah, potato ivy. I'm sure the potato ivy was poisonous." [l][r]
“It really happened?!” [r]
"Good, it's a sweet potato variety" [l][r]
"...???" [r]
Yu looked like he didn't understand at all, but there was probably no need for an explanation. [l][r]

"I get the gist. So you were living there, searching for my body and tools that you could use." [l][r]
"Yeah, it was really hard." [r]
Despite saying that, Yu had a pale face and gave a look of relief. [l][r]
“How did we get here?” I ask, waving my hand around the vehicle where Yu is sitting. [l][r]
"It's quite a short walk from the facility. I sometimes come here to pick up tools and parts."[l][r]
So we were able to meet again by chance? It's perfect timing for the warm season, and it's too much. However, this seems to provide some guidance. [l][r]

Yu continues talking. He said he picked up the gun he had thrown away a while ago, and the pipe he goes through is too narrow to carry it on his back, so he kept it here.[r]
mosquito……. [r]
I block it. [l][r]
[r] "Yu. Listen carefully. You don't have to search for my body anymore." [r]
"Why?" [l][r]
"It's probably not here anymore. Even if it were, it would be dead anyway." [l][r]
“Well, if Chi-chan is fine, that’s fine [r]
...Don't come out disguised, okay? ”[l][r]
"You said you weren't afraid of dead people." [l][r]
“I see.” Yu laughs. With a familiar face. I was so tired that I laughed too. [l][r]

Is Yu here? ! We're meeting, aren't we? ! [l][r]
[r] “What… are you dissatisfied with!?” [r]
I scream. [l][r]
[r]Yu looks at my profile suspiciously and says, "What's wrong?" [r]
Is it not visible to you? In that case, it's him after all... [l][r]
