"So I'm not dead." [l][r]
Chito asked and Yuri answered. The flames flickered across their faces. [l][r]

[r]This is Nagano. It's on a certain mountain in the Northern Alps. As soon as Ishii-san returned home, we made our travel plans, which had been postponed due to various reasons, come true. [l][r]
The members are myself, my wife, Ishii-san, and of course Chito and Yuri. If anyone heard that there was one man and four beautiful women camping, they'd probably be stabbed, but it was tough for us. [l][r]

Only Yuri and I were physically strong enough to climb the mountain. But Yuri was playing around with Chito the whole time and didn't help out at all. Well, I guess that can't be helped. [l][r]
[r]I desperately dragged the luggage of nearly three people to the top of the mountain and collapsed, wondering if this was heaven or hell. It would have been better to stay in a mountain hut, but for some reason everyone except me insisted on camping in tents. [l][r]
[r]Why? [r]
Is camping popular for women? [r]
The equipment is too heavy! [l][r]

“I think it would be better if I could come without dying, but then how [r]
Did you come “this way”? ” Ishii asks, holding a cup of coffee. [l][r]
"Hmm. I don't know," Yuri said. [l][r]
“Hey,” Ishii said. [l][r]

We managed to make it to the tent site just before sunset, set up the tent, and ate some food. [l][r]
The climate is mild, and the scenery and air are nice. What's more, there are only beautiful women around. [l][r]

It was a very delicious meal, but my wife was just talking to Ishii-san, Tito was just talking to Yuri, and I was mostly alone. Well, I'm used to it. [l][r]

[r]And now, we're sitting around a bonfire talking about ``that world.'' Especially the story about how Yuri lived and how he came here. [l][r]

“Anyway, I found a lot of canned goods. So I put them in my backpack and decided to go back, and when I opened the door... it was my room. [r]
Hungarian' [l][r]

[r]Yes, Yuri in this world was the child of a Japanese-Hungarian father and a Japanese mother. [l][r]
His nationality is Japanese. She lives in Japan and Hungary. By the way, his name is "Yuri Kuboy". [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

``So, I was wearing my regular T-shirt, I was out of canned food, and I was hungry, so I didn't know what to do, so I ate the snacks I had in my room and booked a flight online.''[l][r ]
“I think you have the power to take action.” [l][r]
``Ah, did I just get praised?'' Yuri burst out laughing in joy. [l][r]
"Oh, I praised you. That's great. That's great." [l][r]
"Nihehehe" [l][r]
[r]Yuri is happy like a puppy when Chito pats her on the head. What a peaceful head. [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[cm  ]
[tb_start_text mode=3 ]
In other words, if Yuri's story was true, then Chito's hypothesis was wrong. The condition for coming to this world is not necessarily based on "death". [l][r]
[r] Furthermore, Yuri clearly remembered the time when he met Tito at the location of the vehicle. In other words, there seems to be at least a way to send information from one side to the other. [l][r]

"So I decided I had to go to Tokyo, so I told my mom, 'I'm heading to Tokyo for a bit,' and then I biked to the airport, got on a plane, and when I got to Tokyo, Chi-chan was waiting for me!" [l][r]
[r] Yuri shouts with joy from the bottom of her heart, hugging Chito and rubbing his cheek. [l][r]
“Stop it, don’t stick around,” Tito protested, hating it from the bottom of his heart. [l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[tb_start_text mode=3 ]
[r]...We all thought it would be too casual, even though our parents' home was in Japan and we were used to traveling back and forth, but we ignored that. [l][r]
After all, if I continued to listen to what Yuri said, the conversation would never end. [l][r]

[cm] Eventually, Yuri reunited with Tito and moved away from his parents' home to stay in Tito's room, who lived near the university. [l][r]
[r]Although I attended university in Hungary, I went through various procedures and even managed to transfer to the university that Tito attended in Japan. [l][r]
Apparently, she is a highly promising rifle athlete on a scholarship.[l][r]

This conversation continued for several hours. Eventually, my wife and Yuri got sleepy and went into their tents. [l][r]
……picture? Allotment of tent rooms? My wife and Ishii. Chito and Yuri. I'm alone. This is what it is? [l][r]

[r]The number of people decreased, and the number of people speaking suddenly decreased. So I was able to ask Tito what he thought after hearing Yuri's story. [l][r]
Mr. Ishii also said he was interested, so Tito, a little embarrassed, dismissed his previous theory and told me this fairy tale instead. [l][r]

[_tb_end_text]

Despair was very lonely, and wanted to spend a long time enjoying himself with the few people left alive. [l][r]
Uprooting Kanazawa's precious things, [r]
He casually broke Ishii's wings. [l][r]
[r]And approached Tito and Yuri. [l][r]

Only Tito left for the next world. [l][r]

Despair must have been very frightening. [l][r]
And I waited for a once-in-a-lifetime chance. [l][r]

Desperate, Despair spent time with Yuri who remained. [l][r]
