...It's a warm breeze. [l][r]
There don't seem to be many clouds today. [r]

I rolled the tank out of the "room" [r]
The water flowing from the pipe is stored there. [l][r]
[r]How long will this tank last?[r]
Na. Well, it's mostly fine. [l] Use the water while it's flowing, and when it stops, use the water from the tank. When it's gone, I'll go look for it again. [l][r]

Now, let's eat rice. [r]
I think there were about 30 potatoes hanging around. [l][r]
There weren't as many facilities left as there were on the lower level, but they're running low now... but it's okay! [l][r]
[r]...I never thought that you could eat the rope the potatoes were hanging from. Even the leaves. [l][r]
I ate it knowing that it might contain poison that would cause me a lot of pain, but when it turned out to be okay, I danced! [l] You danced! [l] I danced and laughed and cried. [l][r]

You never know that a facility like this exists just below the top layer. [l][r]
However, as that girl said, even if you don't understand it, you have no choice but to move on. [l]That's what I was taught. that's why. [l][r]

[r]Living together was the best. [l][r]
But even if I'm alone, everything that Chi-chan gave me will keep me alive. [l][r]
There are still wonderful things like this. [l][r]
