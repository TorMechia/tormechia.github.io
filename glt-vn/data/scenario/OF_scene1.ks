"I suddenly collapsed! The location is..." [r]
I told myself to stay calm and searched for the words I needed to say. [l][r]
“Stay strong! Hey Chito! Hey [r]
Oh! ” Ishii is shouting. No reply. [l][r]

[r] "Kanazawa! Where's the AED?" [r]
"My wife is going to pick it up. I've arranged for an emergency." [l][r]
I answer immediately while continuing the call. [r]
"I get it!" [l][r]

After saying that, Mr. Ishii opens the chest of Tito's clothes. [l][r]
The girl was lying on her back on the cold floor, her face completely white and not moving at all. [l][r]

"1...2...3...4..." [l][r]
Mr. Ishii calmly and diligently performs the CPR procedures, which I thought I would only have the opportunity to do in license courses or company training. [l][r]
There was no discrepancy between what I vaguely remembered, and I felt that it was appropriate. [l][r]

I told myself to stay calm again and looked around to see if the situation had changed or if there was anything else I should be doing. [l][r]
I saw my wife running towards me with an AED, so I ran towards her. [r]
I took it, which looked like a small bag, and rushed to Tito's side. [l][r]
[r]After giving artificial respiration for the third time, Mr. Ishii's forehead was sweaty and his eyes were wet with tears. [l][r]
I calmly followed the steps without even trying to wipe my tears. She probably didn't even realize she was crying. [l][r]

"Use an AED. Keep the onlookers away[r]
Re” [r]
"I understand." [l][r]
[r]...I do what I have to do. After asking her wife to replace Ishii when she gets tired, she calms down the jeers around her. [l][r]

When I looked at the vehicle again, I saw that Ishii had attached electrodes to Tito's half-naked upper body, so I hurriedly looked away. [l] Just before that, I caught sight of Tito's white face for just a moment. [l][r]
