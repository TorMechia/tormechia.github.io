"At least you're free now. That makes me feel better."[l][r]
I meant what I said, but I wasn't sure if it came across.[l][r]
[r]"...I..."[r]
"I know. It's not your fault."[l][r]
"If only I hadn't looked away, this wouldn't have happened..."[l][r]
[r]Kanazawa mumbles on the other end of the phone. He must be sitting with his head in his hands. Of course he's upset. He was right there and couldn't stop them.[l][r]

He was the one who filed the missing person report. He was the only one there.[l]He wasn't charged or arrested, but after endless hours of questioning, the police's official statement was,[l][r]
[r]"Suicide or accidental disappearance."[l][r]
Such a clich√©, empty phrase.[l][r]

[r]When Kanazawa went back into the warehouse, they were gone.[l][r]
The back door was open, maybe blown by the wind. Beyond it: the sea.[l][r]

There was nothing suspicious about his background, and he had no motive.[l][r]
Without any physical evidence or even an official connection to the girls, that was the best the police could conclude.[l][r]
[r]The search of the nearby coastline continues, but so far, there's been no news.[l][r]

"...You shouldn't blame yourself. I know it's hard, but, I always felt it would end this way."[l][r]
"..."[r]
There's no response from the phone.[r]
I continue regardless.[l][r]
[r]"Yuu kept telling me that Chito was at her limit. Every time I heard from her, more of the Chito I knew was gone.[l][r]
She tried to fight the despair, but it crushed her."[l][r]
"We... we did nothing, didn't we?"[l][r]
"Sorry...?"[l][r]
"We couldn't do anything, could we?"[l][r]

Kanazawa asked the question, knowing the answer.[l][r]
[r]"Ishii-san, aren't you sad? Angry?"[r]
"...Of course I am. But they made their choice. It was never something we could decide for them."[l][r]
[r]I try to steady my voice, exhaling slowly.[l][r]

I look to the eastern sky, remembering the Tokyo nights I spent walking with Chito.[l][r]
[r]The world was just too small for them. The world they discovered together was shrinking, and they couldn't see what really mattered anymore.[l][r]
So, they didn't die.[l][r]

"They set off on another journey. To that world they lived in together. A world that ended, letting them truly feel each other."[l][r]
"That's..."[r]
"You saw it for a moment, didn't you? The key in the Kettenkrad that shouldn't have been there."[l][r]
"..."[r]
"So, it's okay to believe that now."[l][r]
[r]I stop speaking. Kanazawa has no retort.[l][r]

On this rooftop where I once talked to Chito, I remember them and feel the longing in my heart.[l][r]
But today's different. A clear blue sky, as if celebrating their departure, mocking us with its purity.[l][r]
[r]I look up, take a deep breath, and start talking to the phone again.[l][r]

"Did you name them?"[l][r]
"What...?"[l][r]
"Your kids. Sorry I'm late. I heard they're twin girls. Congrats. Take good care of your wife."[l][r]
"Oh... yes."[l][r]
"You'll be a dad. Be there for them. So, what did you name them? Don't tell me, Chito and Yuu?"[l][r]
"No, of course not.[r]
...They're still out there, right? The two of them, still traveling."[l][r]
"Yes. I'm sure of it."[r]
"Yeah..."[l][r]

As I listen to Kanazawa's voice, I close my eyes without realizing.[l][r]
A dry wind blows, rustling my hair.[l][r]
[r]On the phone, a voice that once shared the same despair.[l][r]
It feels like the last lingering scent of that gray world.[l][r]

I hear a sound from afar.[l][r]

The heavy tracks scraping the ground.[r]
Despite the weight, the engine ran smoothly.[l][r]
