I'm happy.[l][r]
My parents are a little strict, but they're kind; school is a bit boring, but comfortable enough.[l][r]
I think that being a library committee member suits me, and talking to my book-loving friends is fun.[l][r]

[r]I don't have to worry about finding food, melting snow for water, buildings collapsing and falling on top of my head, or shivering in the cold while waiting for the sun to rise.[l][r]

[r]How is it that I'm so happy, so privileged, and yet I feel so...[l][r]
... lonely?[l][r]

[r]Something inside me is crying out.[l][r]

A gray fog is in front of me. It flows in and out of existenceâ€”sometimes manifesting slowly, and sometimes flashing into my vision.[l][r]
When it gets too big to ignore, I reach out to it, desperate to stop thinking about all of this.[l][r]
[r]It's okay.[r]
I understand.[r]
Don't cry.[l][r]

[r]I cradle the fog's head, gently patting it.[l][r]
The fog thickens, its shape slowly changing; eventually, it reveals a clear image.[l][r]

A small child.[r]
Wearing dirty, tattered clothes, a spitting image of my younger self from that world.[l][r]

"What's wrong?" I ask.[l][r]
"I'm lonely..." she answers.[l][r]
"It's okay," I comfort her.[l][r]
"It's not okay..." she whines.[l][r]
"There's not much to be done, though..."[l][r]
"No..."[l][r]
[r]She refuses to listen to my words,[r]
or to stop crying.[l][r]

"I want to see you... I want to see you...![r]
Yuu... Yuu![r]
... Where are you? ... Where are you!?"[l][r]
She begins to wail.[l][r]
I hold my head and try to block my ears.[l][r]
But my crying, screaming voice[r]
shakes my eardrums and my whole being.[l][r]
[_tb_end_text]

[tb_start_text mode=3 ]
[r]My head feels like it's about to split in half.[l][r]
My heart feels like it's about to tear apart.[l][r]
Stop screaming. Stop crying.[r]
I wished for nothing else as I desperately hugged myself.[l][r]

Eventually, exhausted from all the crying, her form returns to the original fog and dissipates.[l][r]

... How many times has this happened now?[l][r]
Cursing this nightmare for getting to me on the night before a test, I shake my aching head with a groan and make a futile attempt at going back to sleep.
